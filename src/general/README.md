# README

General, shared, and utils are all common parts, but here the specification is: 
- general: Must be unrelated to this project. The contents in this folder can be moved to other projects for reuse.
- shared: Multiple components need to share.
- utils: Small tools. Since they are all small tools, they can sometimes be reused, but they do not emphasize reusability.

`InOb` version: 

- Convert the general module into a module with `Obsidian` dependencies and replace the general module.
