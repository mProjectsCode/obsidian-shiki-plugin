### Rendering engine

Shiki, PrismJS, CodeMirror

- Shiki: A powerful code highlighting engine.
  - More powerful functions, more themes and plugins
  - Plugins: meta annotations, annotated annotations. Line highlighting, word highlighting, differentiated annotation, warning/error annotation
  - Theme: Nearly 80 color schemes: You can visually select them at https://textmate-grammars-themes.netlify.app
  - *The min version does not include this library and the engine cannot be selected*
- PrismJS: The rendering engine that Obsidian uses by default in reading mode.
  - When choosing this one, you can also select the min version of this plugin, which has a smaller plugin size and a faster loading speed
  - It can be color-matched with code using obsidian themes and can be used in conjunction with some other obsidian stylization plugins
- CodeMirror: Obsidian is the default rendering engine used in real-time mode. The current plugin is not supported
  - It is suitable for real-time rendering and has acceptable performance
  - However, the code analysis is rather rough, with a small number of highlighting layers and a poor effect

### Rendering method

- textarea (default)
  - Advantage:
    Allows real-time editing and offers a Typora-like WYSIWYG experience
    Support editing annotation-type highlighting
    The new version of Obsidian's md table within block editing uses this approach. (However, the ob table editing does not trigger a re-rendering.)
  - Disadvantage:
    In principle, textarea and pre are perfectly overlapped together, but they are prone to incomplete overlap due to the influence of themes and styles
- pre
  - Disadvantage:
    Real-time editing is not allowed. The rendering effect is more similar to the textarea method
- editable pre
  - Advantage:
    Allows real-time editing and offers a Typora-like WYSIWYG experience
    In principle, it is `code[contenteditable='true']`
  - Disadvantage:
    The cursor position needs to be handled manually in the program
    *No support editing annotation-type highlighting*
- codemirror
  - Disadvantage:
    The only supported method for V0.5.0 and earlier versions, which does not allow real-time editing

> [!warning]
> 
> If a real-time editable solution is chosen, it is best to use it when the warehouse is regularly backed up to avoid unexpected situations

### AutoSave method

- onchange
  - Advantage:
    Great performance.
    There is no need to manage the cursor position manually
  - Disadvantage:
    Delay save, change will loss if: the program crashes suddenly. when cursor in codeblock, switch to readmode or close window/tab
- oninput
  - Advantage:
    Save immediately, data is more secure.
    The new version of Obsidian's md table within block editing uses this approach.
  - Disadvantage:
    Worse performance? The code block needs to be recreated every time it is modified
    The cursor position needs to be handled manually. Debounce manually.
    It is necessary to pay attention to the input method issue. The `oninput` will also be triggered during the input candidate stage

This is a simple summary of grammar:

- notaion
  - diff:            `// [!code ++]` `// [!code --]`
  - highlight:       `// [!code hl]` `// [!code highlight]`
  - word highlight:  `// [!code word:<Word>:<number>]` `// [!code word:Hello:1]`
  - focus:           `// [!code focus]`
  - error level:     `// [!code error]` `// [!code warning]`
  - (mul line):      `// [!code highlight:3]`
- meta
  - highlight:       `{1,3-4}`
  - word highlight   `/<Word>/` `/Hello/`
